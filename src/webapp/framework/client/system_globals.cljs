(def record-pointer-locally
  "
 This determines whether the mouse pointer events are
 recorded for the local Coils debugger. For an example
 of mouse pointer events looks at the playback of a Coils
 app where you can see where the website user moved the
 mouse. In the React/Om UI tree this is stored in:

  {
     :pointer
     {
         :mouse-x 0
         :mouse-y 0
     }
  }


 To enable or disable this you must be specify
 it as a global setting in system_globals.clj as

 (defonce ^:dynamic *record-pointer-locally* false)
  "
  (atom true))









(def start-component
  "
 This is a reference to the first component of a Coils
 app that must be loaded


 It is actually specified in:

  src/webapp/framework/client/main/main.cljs

 :in the functions:

  load_main
  load_admin
  load_debug

 :These are called from the first webpage that is loaded
  in coils. See the file:

  resources/public/main.html

  : and you will find:

   webapp.framework.client.main.load_main(
                                    webapp.framework.client.init.setup);

  Looking at:

  webapp.framework.client.init/setup

  :you will see:


(def  ^:export setup
